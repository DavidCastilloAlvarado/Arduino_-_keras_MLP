# Deep machine learning - Arduino & Keras
How to make a neural network and deploy inside arduino. 

The goal of this project is create a simple neural network and deploy in arduino hardware completely autonomous. 

The due is make a cheap hardware that can handle a little tiny machine learning model for avoid accident that could make serious injuries
