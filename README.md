# Deep machine learning - Arduino & Keras
How to make a neural network and deploy inside arduino.
The goal of this proyect is create a simple neural network and deploy in arduino hardware
completly autonomus. 
The due is make a cheap harware that can handled a litle tiny machine learning model
for avoid accident that could make serious injuries
